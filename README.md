# Words with Friends
My team replicated the popular game, [Words with Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_with_Friends). We used the [Oxford Dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) to determine whether the players use valid words. This Project was divided into several components. First the Sign In/Sign out of the web app was handled by Christian Hahn. Charlye Castro was in charge of the Game Invitation/Available Players. Ian Figon took care of the Letter Tiles and Board algorithms. Finally, I design the overall UI&UX and set up the API. This web app uses the React js framework, and Firebase servers to host user data.
